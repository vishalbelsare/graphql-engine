Hasura Alerts is a feature available to Cloud customers that proactively notifies you about important events and
incidents in your Hasura infrastructure. It enables you to define specific conditions and thresholds to trigger alerts,
ensuring you stay informed about critical changes and potential performance and reliability issues in real-time.

### Key benefits

- **Faster Incident Resolution** - By receiving timely alerts, users can quickly identify incidents and take immediate
  action to address them. This reduces the time it takes to detect and respond to issues, minimizing their impact on
  system performance and user experience.
- **Improved Reliability** - By promptly detecting and resolving incidents, Hasura Alerts helps improve the overall
  reliability. Users can proactively address potential issues before they impact end-users, resulting in enhanced system
  stability and user satisfaction.
- **Performance Issue Detection** - Performance issues can arise within or downstream from Hasura infrastructure. With
  alerting, users can monitor important performance metrics and receive notifications when thresholds are breached. This
  allows for timely intervention and optimization, ensuring optimal system performance.
- **Root Cause Identification** - Incidents often have downstream causes that originate from outside the Hasura
  infrastructure itself. Proactive alerting helps users quickly trace these issues to their root causes, enabling more
  efficient troubleshooting and resolution.

## Notification channels and integrations

Hasura Alerts support email and Slack notifications. This allows you to receive alerts through preferred communication
channels, increasing accessibility and response efficiency. The diagram below illustrates the architecture of how alerts
can be configured. To learn more about how to configure alerts, see
