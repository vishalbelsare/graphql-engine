## Configuration

You can easily configure alerts for your Hasura Cloud project on the Cloud Dashboard. Navigate to the
`Project Detail -> Alerting` menu and enable the feature in just a few clicks.

In the screenshot below, we've toggled the `Enable Alert` option and added a single recipient's email address:

## Alert Rules

Hasura Cloud supports a set of common alert rules for performance observability such as:

- Metadata health
- High latency
- Error rates of GraphQL requests, subscriptions, and Event Triggers.

To choose which alerts you receive, click on `Configure Alerts` to open the configuration dialog:
