# Commands

## Overview

The Hasura CLI Gateway plugin utilizes a typical command / flag syntax enabling you to quickly manage your Hasura
federated instances under a parent gateway instance. A typical command structure will follow this pattern:

```bash
hasura gateway --<flag> "<flag_value>" <command>
```

A real-world example following this structure would be:

```bash
hasura gateway --gateway-url https://gateway-hasura-app.hasura.app --gateway-configuration-file /path/to/gateway-configuration.json --admin-secret myadminsecret check
```

This snippet illustrates the `check` command with three flags and their respective values (i.e., `gateway-url`,
`gateway-configuration-file`, and `admin-secret`).

:::info Gateway configuration file format

A sample gateway configuration, which represents the child Hasura instance's Remote Schema, looks like this:

```json
{
  "name": "hasura-1",
  "definition": {
    "url": "https://hasura-1.hasura.app/v1/graphql",
    "timeout_seconds": 60,
    "customization": {},
    "headers": [
      {
        "name": "x-hasura-admin-secret",
        "value": "hasura-1-admin-secret"
      }
    ],
    "forward_client_headers": true
  },
  "comment": "Hasura Child instance 1 for this parent gateway"
}
```
