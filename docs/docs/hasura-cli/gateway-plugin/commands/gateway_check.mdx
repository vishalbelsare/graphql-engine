# Hasura CLI: gateway check

Check the compatibility of the child Remote Schema configuration with the gateway configuration.

## Synopsis

This command reads the Remote Schema configuration of the current child Hasura present in the file mentioned by the flag
`--gateway-configuration-file`, appends it to the gateway's metadata, and checks for consistency of the final metadata with
the gateway. Please note:

- `gateway-url`, `gateway-configuration-file`, and the gateway's `admin-secret` are required to run this command.

```bash
hasura gateway [flags] check
```

## Usage

```bash
# Checking compatibility of the configuration present in gateway-configuration.json with gateway instance
hasura gateway --gateway-url https://gateway-hasura-app.hasura.app --gateway-configuration-file /path/to/gateway-configuration.json --admin-secret myadminsecret check

```

## Options

```sass
    --gateway-url string                  url of the gateway instance
    --gateway-configuration-file string   path to the current Hasura's configuration
    --admin-secret string                 admin secret of the gateway
-h, --help                                help for check
