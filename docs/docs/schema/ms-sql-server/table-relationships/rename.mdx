# MS SQL Server: Rename Relationships

An existing relationship can be renamed as follows:

<Tabs groupId="user-preference" className="api-tabs">
<TabItem value="console" label="Console">

**Renaming Local Relationships**

- Head to `Data -> [table-name] -> Relationships` in the Console
- Click on the `Rename` option for the relationship in question.

- This will open up a pop-up widget which will allow you to rename and save the relationship

**Renaming Remote Relationships**

Remote relationships cannot be renamed. They have to dropped and created again with the new name.

<TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">

You can rename a relationship by changing the relationship name in the `tables.yaml` file inside the `metadata`
directory:

```yaml {5}
- table:
    schema: public
    name: articles
  object_relationships:
    - name: author
      using:
        foreign_key_constraint_on: author_id
- table:
    schema: public
    name: authors
```

Apply the Metadata by running:

```bash
hasura metadata apply
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="api" label="API">

You can rename a relationship by using the
[mssql_rename_relationship Metadata API](/api-reference/metadata-api/relationship.mdx#mssql-rename-relationship):

```http
POST /v1/metadata HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
X-Hasura-Role: admin

{
  "type": "mssql_rename_relationship",
  "args": {
    "source": "<db_name>",
    "table": "articles",
    "name": "article_details",
    "new_name": "article_detail"
  }
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::info Note

You might not be allowed to drop a relationship if it has been referenced elsewhere (e.g. in a permissions rule).

In this case you will have to delete the references first, rename the relationship, and then re-add the references.
