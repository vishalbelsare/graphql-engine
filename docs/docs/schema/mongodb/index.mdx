# MongoDB: Schema

The Hasura GraphQL Engine automatically generates your GraphQL schema and resolvers based on your tables/views in
MongoDB. **You don't need to write a GraphQL schema or resolvers.** See
[How Hasura GraphQL Engine works](/getting-started/how-it-works/index.mdx) for more details.

The Hasura Console gives you UI tools that speed up your data-modeling process, or working with your existing database.

**See:**

- [Define Collection and View Schemas with Logical Models](/schema/mongodb/logical-models.mdx)
