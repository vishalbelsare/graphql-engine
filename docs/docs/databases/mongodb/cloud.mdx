# Get Started with MongoDB in Hasura Cloud

<ProductBadge free pro ee />

## Introduction

This guide will help you get set up with [Hasura Cloud](/hasura-cloud/overview.mdx) and our MongoDB integration. This is
the easiest way to set up Hasura Engine and the MongoDB GraphQL Data Connector.

:::tip Supported versions:

Hasura GraphQL Engine `v2.27.0` onwards

:::

:::tip Supported features

Hasura currently supports queries, table relationships, remote relationships and permissions on MongoDB databases.

A [logical model](/schema/mongodb/logical-models.mdx) or database
[validation schema](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/upcoming/core/schema-validation/specify-json-schema/#std-label-schema-validation-json)
is required for generating your GraphQL schema.

:::

## Try it out

### Step 1: Create an account on Hasura Cloud and create a new Hasura Project

Navigate to your [Hasura Cloud account](https://cloud.hasura.io/) or [create a new one](https://cloud.hasura.io/signup/?pg=docs&plcmt=body&cta=navigate-to-cloud-hasura-io&tech=default&skip_onboarding=true) if you do not have one.

Create a project on Hasura Cloud and hit the "Launch Console" button to open the Hasura Console for your project.

### Step 2: Connect to MongoDB

From the Console, visit `Data` > `Manage` to connect your MongoDB database.

Then click, `Connect Database`.

Connect your database using the following details:

- Database Name: (visual name of the database in Hasura)
- Connection: (in the format of `mongodb://[username]:[password]@[host]:[port]`)
- db: (name of the MongoDB database being connected to)

### Step 3: Tracking Collections

Once your database has been connected, select the database name from the left-hand sidebar.

You should see your `users` Collection listed here. Select it, and select `Track Selected`.

:::info How do we generate your Collection's schema?

Since MongoDB is a NoSQL database, Documents can be variable within each of the Collections.
Hasura supports and recommends defining a [logical model](/schema/mongodb/logical-models.mdx) for each Collection
which will define the Document schema.

We also support optionally generating a schema automatically from your database's
[validation schema](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/upcoming/core/schema-validation/specify-json-schema/#std-label-schema-validation-json)
if one is available.

:::

You will now see a modal with a few options for setting up your Collection's schema.

- **Infer Schema from Document** allows you to take a single Document from your Collection and infer the  
- **Use Existing Logical Model** allows you to select a previously created [logical model](/schema/mongodb/logical-models.mdx).
- **Use Database Schema** allows you to use your database's
  [validation schema](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/upcoming/core/schema-validation/specify-json-schema/#std-label-schema-validation-json)
  if one is present in your database (a GraphQL schema will be automatically generated for you).

Your Collection has now added to your GraphQL API! ðŸŽ‰

:::info Make your Collection available to other roles

By default, this Collection is only available to `admin` users. To make it available for more user groups, select the
Collection name from the left-hand sidebar, and select `Permissions` to setup permission rules for the Collection. You
can read more about permissions [here](/auth/authorization/index.mdx).

:::

### Step 4: Running your first query

Click on the API tab in the Console navigation which will take you to GraphiQL, our API testing tool.

Utilize the explorer located on the left-hand sidebar to assist you in composing your query (the resulting query will
be populated in the body area). When youâ€™re ready, click on the play button to execute your GraphQL query.
Your queryâ€™s result will be populated in the right-hand column of the interface.
